# Solar Charger

Solar-powered Li-ion charging and power management system implemented on a custom PCB.

## Overview
This project focuses on hardware design for managing variable solar input while safely charging a Li-ion battery and delivering regulated power rails. The system integrates dedicated charge controllers, buck/boost DC-DC converters, and an ESP32 for monitoring and control.

## Key Features
- Custom PCB design for solar-powered Li-ion charging
- Buck and boost DC-DC converters for regulated 5 V and 3.3 V outputs
- Battery voltage/current sensing and power-path management
- ESP32-based monitoring and control logic

## Tools & Technologies
- PCB Design: KiCad / Altium
- Power Electronics: Li-ion charge controllers, switching regulators
- Embedded: ESP32
